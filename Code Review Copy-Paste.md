## For Questions

### Broken Code

Use for questions where the code is not working correctly. It links to the Stack Overflow "how to ask" page so the user can read their guidelines before posting, to avoid getting down-voted or closed there.

> Welcome to Code Review. If your code is not working correctly, it is off-topic for this site. You might try [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) if you can word the question in a way that fits the criteria on that page. Once your code works correctly, you're welcome to ask a new question here and we can then help you improve it!

```

### Code Not Written

Use for questions where the OP wants all or part of the code written or modified. 

> Welcome to Code Review. Asking for advice on code yet to be written or implemented is off-topic for this site. See [What topics can I ask about?](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic) for reference. Once you have written working code, you're welcome to ask a new question here and we can then help you improve it!

This version is intended more so for questions of the nature _"I need to do X, can you help writing the code?"_

> Welcome to Code Review. We do not provide code-writing servicces here. We recommend that you search online tutorials and examples in order for you to learn how to write your own code. See [What topics can I ask about?](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic) for reference.

### Pseudo/Example/Stub Code

Use for questions where the code is either not written using a real language (pesudo-code), is obviously example code rather than real implementation (e.g.: `function MyFunction(foo, bar)`), or where important parts of the code have been omitted (e.g.: `// ... validation methods here...`).

> Welcome to Code Review. The code you presented in its current form is not meaningfully reviewable. We only review real, working code. If you edit your question to contain your actual code we can review it for improvements. See [What topics can I ask about?](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic) for reference.

### Code Behind Link

Use for questions where the code is not included in the post, and rather is behind a link, for example Github, repl.it, jsfiddle, etc.

> Welcome to Code Review. Unfortunately your question is off-topic as of now, as the code to be reviewed must be [present in the question](https://codereview.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1308). Code behind links is considered non-reviewable. Please add the code you want reviewed in your question. Thank you.

### Answer Invalidation

Use for edits to questions that do invalidate answers, for example the OP changing or adding updated code into the question after receiving answers. Useful to handle messages from Duga bot in [The 2nd Monitor](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/8595/the-2nd-monitor) like _"possible answer invalidation by [user] on question by [user]"_.

> I have rolled back your last edit. Please don't change or add to the code in your question after you have received answers. See [What should I do when someone answers my question?](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/someone-answers) Thank you.

```

## For Answers

### Not An Answer

Use for answers that clearly do not answer the question at all, for example _"This really helped me!"_ or someone asking a new question. This should also be accompanied by flagging as "Not An Answer" and probably a down-vote, at your discretion.

> The answer you posted does not attempt to review the post in question. See [How do I write a good answer?](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-answer) for reference.

```


### Link Only Answer

Use for answers which are mostly or entirely links to another site, whether on Stack Overflow/Stack Exchange or an external resource.

> Thank you for attempting to answer. Link-only answers are discouraged in part because links can become stale or broken, and also because it doesn't really provide a review of the code in question. See [How do I write a good answer?](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-answer) for reference.
